# Score-analysis-test

## Introduction
This project is meant to serve two purposes. The first is to analyse and evaluate the effects of outer factors on students' academic performances. The second is to predict future students' score based on previous data.

## Datasets
This project extracted fictional student data from Dr. Royce Kimmons’ [exam score generator](roycekimmons.com/tools/generated\_data/exams) [1]. This data generator ensured that there are no missing data. The data is in the form of a .csv file. The headers are "gender", "race/ethnicity", "parental level of education", "lunch", "test preparation course", "math score", "reading score", "writing score".
